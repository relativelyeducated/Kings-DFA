## Breakthroughs Being Applied

### Breakthrough 1: S/R Physical Identification
- **Date Discovered**: 2025-11-24
- **Core Insight**: S = GRAVITY (least action, constraint) | R = THERMODYNAMICS (entropy, relations)
- **Key Claim**: Life = Thermal fighting Gravity. All living systems are R-axis pushing against S-axis collapse.
- **Mathematical Form**:
  - S-axis: Gravity, Force, Potential Energy, Least Action Principle
  - R-axis: Thermal, Momentum, Kinetic Energy, Entropy Maximization
- **Documents to Update**: MATHEMATICS.md, docs/02_CORE_FRAMEWORK.md, docs/03_MOMENTUM_FORMULATION.md
- **Status**: 🟡 In Progress
