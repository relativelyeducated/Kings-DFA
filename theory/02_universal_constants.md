# Universal Constants

## The Two Constants

KDFA identifies two universal constants that appear across all domains:

### 1. The Coupling Threshold: kappa = 1/e

$$\kappa_{crit} = \frac{1}{e} \approx 0.3679$$

This threshold appears in:
- Virial systems (stellar formation)
- Cosmological structure
- Sleep/wake transitions
- Elite wealth concentration

### 2. The Packing Dimension: D2 = 19/13

$$D_2 = \frac{19}{13} = 1.46153...$$

This fractal dimension appears in:
- Metallic glass structure (d2 = 1.46 +/- 0.06)
- Earthquake energy distribution
- Brain criticality
- Granular jamming

## Vesica Piscis Derivation

At virial equilibrium (d/R = 0.5), the vesica piscis geometry yields:
- Overlap fraction = 0.685 (dark energy)
- Non-overlap fraction = 0.315 (matter)
- Inverse overlap = 1/0.685 = 1.46 (D2)

## Cross-Domain Validation

| Constant | Domain | Predicted | Observed | Error |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1/e | Cosmology | 0.368 | 0.35-0.37 | <5% |
| 1/e | Sleep | 0.368 | 0.33-0.38 | <3% |
| D2 | Metallic glass | 1.4615 | 1.46 | <1% |
| D2 | Earthquakes | 1.4615 | 1.46 | <2% |
