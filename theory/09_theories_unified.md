## Cross-Domain Unification

### Universal Patterns

1. **Threshold at $\kappa \approx 0.35$:**
   - Viability minimum (biology)
   - Jeans instability (astrophysics)
   - Phase transition (statistical mechanics)

2. **Optimum at $\kappa \approx 0.50$:**
   - Balance systems (HRV, immune, stress)
   - Maximum complexity (information theory)
   - Peak entropy production (thermodynamics)

3. **Upper bound at $\kappa \approx 0.65$:**
   - Structure formation peak (cosmology)
   - Pathology onset (medicine)
   - Economic instability (finance)

### Emergence Hierarchy

Systems exhibit nested S-R coupling:

```
Cosmic scale (κ ~ 0.92, Zone 4) → Senescent universe
    ↓
Galactic scale (κ ~ 0.40, Zone 2) → Star formation viable
    ↓
Stellar scale (κ ~ 0.45, Zone 3) → Main sequence stars
    ↓
Planetary scale (κ ~ 0.30, Zone 2) → Geologically active
    ↓
Biological scale (κ ~ 0.50, Zone 3) → Living organisms
    ↓
Cellular scale (κ ~ 0.45, Zone 3) → Optimal metabolism
    ↓
Molecular scale (κ < 0.35, Zone 1) → Stable structures
```

**Pattern:** Life exists at scales where $\kappa \in [0.35, 0.65]$ (Zones 2-3)
