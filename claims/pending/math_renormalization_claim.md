# Claim: Renormalization Group Flow

## Source
Grok Export 028

## Statement
Constants \(C^*, \alpha, N\) arise from fixed-point analysis of the S + R flow under RG transformation.
- \(C^*\) from minimizing \(\mathcal{J}(C)\).
- \(\alpha\) from optimizing relational braiding.
- \(N\) from Lyapunov exponent stability.

## Context
Links DFA to renormalization group theory.
