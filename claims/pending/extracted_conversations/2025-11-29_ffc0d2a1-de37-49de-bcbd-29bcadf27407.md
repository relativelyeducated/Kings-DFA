# GitHub access and available tools

Can you use GitHub connectors to access the GitHub

## assistant
 I don't have GitHub connectors or tools available in this conversation. Looking at my available tools, I have access to:

- **Google Drive** (search and fetch documents)
- **Hugging Face** (models, datasets, papers, spaces, documentation)
- **PubMed** (biomedical research articles)
- **Web search and fetch**
- **Computer/bash tools** (for running code, creating files)
- **Calendar, alarms, timers, location, and maps**
- **Past conversation search**
- **Memory management**

If you need to work with GitHub repositories, I have a few options:

1. **Web fetch** - I can fetch public GitHub pages, READMEs, or raw file contents if you give me specific URLs
2. **Bash tools** - I can clone public repositories and work with them in my Linux environment
3. **You could enable a GitHub integration** - Check your Claude settings to see if GitHub MCP tools can be connected

What are you trying to accomplish with GitHub? I can probably help through one of these alternative approaches.

## human
It says I have it in connector manager and it is connected

## assistant
 Interesting - if your connector manager shows GitHub as connected, it may not be exposing tools to me in this particular conversation session. Let me check what tools I actually have available by looking at what was provided:

Looking at my tool list, I don't see any GitHub-specific functions like `github_search`, `github_repo_fetch`, `github_file_read`, or similar. The Hugging Face tools I have are specifically for the Hugging Face Hub (models, datasets, spaces, papers), not GitHub.

A few possibilities:

1. **Session sync issue** - Sometimes newly connected integrations need a fresh conversation to appear. Try starting a new chat and see if GitHub tools show up.

2. **Permissions scope** - The connector might be authenticated but not fully authorized to expose tools yet.

3. **Different connector type** - Some connectors provide context/data but not direct tool access.

**What you can try:**

- Refresh the page or start a new conversation
- Disconnect and reconnect the GitHub integration in your connector manager
- Check if there are any permission prompts you need to approve on the GitHub side

In the meantime, if you share what you're trying to do with GitHub, I can likely help using web fetch (for public repos) or by cloning repos in my bash environment. What did you have in mind?

## human
I'll check it on PC this still the phone

## assistant
 Sounds good! The mobile app sometimes has quirks with connectors compared to the desktop/web experience. Checking on PC makes sense.

When you get there, you might:

- Look for any pending authorization prompts
- Try toggling the GitHub connector off and back on
- Start a fresh conversation after confirming it's connected

Just ping me when you're set up and we can dig into whatever you needed from GitHub. In the meantime, let me know if there's anything else I can help with!

## human
Search Claude for why it might not be working

Here's what I found:

## Common GitHub Connector Issues

**1. Repository Access Permissions**
Even when connected, Claude may only show some repositories. A solution that worked for others: go to https://github.com/apps/claude-for-github/installations/select_target and explicitly grant access to specific repos you want Claude to see.

**2. Known Sync Bug (Recent)**
There's a reported bug where GitHub repository synchronization is broken in Claude Projects. Despite the connector showing as "Connected" with all permissions enabled, repository files are not accessible. Multiple users reported similar issues, suggesting a platform-wide regression.

**3. Connect Button Not Working**
Some users report the GitHub integration "Connect" button is non-functional across both Claude web and Desktop - clicking it does nothing (no authentication flow, no error message).

## Things to Try on PC

1. **Re-authorize the GitHub App directly:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/apps/claude-for-github/installations/select_target
   - Select your GitHub user/org and grant access to specific repos

2. **Disconnect and reconnect** the integration in Claude settings

3. **Start a fresh conversation** after reconnecting

4. **Try pasting a GitHub URL directly** - some users found that even when repos don't appear in the list, using "paste Github URL" in the Claude desktop app worked for adding private repos.

5. **Check for pending org approvals** if it's an organization repo

The integration is still in beta, so there are definitely some rough edges. Let me know what you find when you get to the PC!
