# Claim: Identity Operator Emergence

## Source
Grok Export 028

## Statement
The identity operator \(\mathbb{I}\) emerges as the fixed point of the dialectical synthesis:
\[
\mathbb{I} = \lim_{k \to N} \mathcal{T}^k (\Psi_0) = \sum_i |i\rangle \langle i |
\]
where \(\mathcal{T} = \oplus \circ \partial_k\) is the recursion operator.

## Context
Analogous to Noether's theorem: dialectical symmetry implies conserved identity.
