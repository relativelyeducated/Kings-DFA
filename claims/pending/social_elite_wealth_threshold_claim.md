# Claim: Elite Wealth Instability Threshold ($1/e \approx 36.8\%$)

## Source
User Request & Turchin Analysis - Nov 30, 2025

## Statement
The DFA predicts that social instability becomes critical when the **Top 1% Wealth Share** exceeds the **Survival Threshold** of $\kappa_{crit} = 1/e \approx 36.8\%$.

## Evidence
- **Current Status**: US Top 1% holds **~30.8%** of wealth (2024), up from 22.8% (1989).
- **Trend**: The system is approaching the 36.8% boundary.
- **Turchin's Prediction**: "Age of Discord" (2020s) coincides with this approach to the threshold.
- **Mechanism**:
    - **$\kappa < 1/e$**: Stable hierarchy (Zone 1/2).
    - **$\kappa > 1/e$**: Elite Overproduction (Zone 3). The "Wealth Pump" extracts too much surplus, decoupling the elite from the populace (R-dominance without S-accountability).

## SNAP Connection
- **Observation**: SNAP participation peaked at **15%** (2013), which is close to $1/e^2 \approx 13.5\%$.
- **Hypothesis**: As Elite Wealth approaches $1/e$, Scarcity (SNAP) scales as $1/e^2$ or similar power law.

**PROPOSED** (Nov 30, 2025).

## Historical Validation Data

### 1. United States (1929 vs 2024)
- **1929 Peak**: The Top 1% wealth share reached **~45-50%** (Saez & Zucman) just before the Great Depression.
    - **Result**: System Collapse (Great Depression).
    - **DFA Check**: $45\% > 36.8\%$ (Zone 3 Instability).
- **2020s Status**:
    - **Saez-Zucman (Capitalization)**: Estimates **~42%** (crossed threshold ~2010).
    - **Federal Reserve (Distributive)**: Estimates **30.8%** (approaching threshold).
    - **Trend**: Both metrics show rapid ascent from ~23% in 1978.
    - **DFA Interpretation**: Depending on the metric, we are either *approaching* or *deep inside* the instability zone.

### 2. French Revolution (1789)
- **Data**: Top 1% held **~60%** of wealth. Top 10% held **~90%**.
- **Result**: Total System Collapse (Revolution).
- **DFA Check**: $60\% \gg 36.8\%$ (Extreme Zone 3).

### 3. Roman Empire (150 CE - Pax Romana)
- **Data**: Top 1% held **~16%**.
- **Result**: Peak Stability (Golden Age).
- **DFA Check**: $16\% < 36.8\%$ (Zone 1/2 Stability).

## Analysis
The $1/e \approx 36.8\%$ threshold appears to correctly separate stable periods (Rome 150 CE) from collapse periods (France 1789, US 1929). The current US status is critical, with some metrics already signaling a breach.
