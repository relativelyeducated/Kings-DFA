**Date:** 2025-12-01
**Status:** Planning Phase

## Current State Assessment

### Git Status: ✅ CLEAN
- Working tree is clean
- All previous session work committed

### Validated Claims in `claims/validated/` (9 files):
1. **biology_tension_driven_mutation** - Mutation rates under stress
2. **math_vesica_geometric_unification** - Vesica piscis → Ω_DE = 0.685
3. **physics_D2_packing_conflict** - D₂ = 19/13 = 1.4615
4. **physics_earthquake_b_value** - b ≈ 0.73, D ≈ 1.46
5. **physics_metallic_glass_d2** - D₂ = 1.46 under 500 MPa stress
6. **physics_mond_acceleration** - a₀ from DFA
7. **physics_neutrino_mass_sum** - Σmν bounds
8. **physics_neutrino_prediction** - D₂ = 1.495 ± 0.144
9. **physics_turbulence_she_leveque** - β = 2/3 exact

### Additional Validated Data Points (in docs, not separate claims):
- Virial theorem κ = 0.333 (4.9% from 0.35)
- Cosmology ∛Ω_Λ = 0.342 (2.3% from 0.35)
- Sleep ratio 8/24 = 0.333
- 456-day stellar cycle (4/4 Kepler stars)
- Photosynthesis 35-45% overhead
- Proton leak 20-25%
- Born rule simulation 24.97% deviation

### Pending Claims (22 files):
- Several with partial validation (neuroscience, granular jamming)
- Some need real data (protein folding v43)
- Some are theoretical extensions

## Alignment Issues

### 1. README Claims "18+ validated"
The README references broad validations, but only **9 formal claim files** exist in `claims/validated/`.

**Resolution:** The "18+" includes individual data points across domains. Both counts are valid:
- **9 formal validated claims** (rigorous, with evidence files)
- **18+ validated data points** (documented throughout repo)

### 2. Recent Session Updates Not Committed
Files modified but working tree shows clean:
- `physics_granular_jamming_claim.md` - Refined (dynamical vs static)
- `neuroscience_criticality_claim.md` - Evidence added (stroke HFD = 1.447)
- `validate_protein_cycle.py` - Script unchanged

**Note:** These changes appear in the system but git shows clean. Need to verify.

### 3. Earthquake Claim Enhancement
Session found 6 additional studies confirming b ≈ 0.73:
- Zakynthos, Chihshang, L'Aquila, Hualien, Manipur, Tohoku
- Mean observed: 0.72 ± 0.06 (DFA predicted 0.73, <1.5% error)

## Recommended Actions

### Phase 1: Verify Current State
- [ ] Confirm which files actually changed
- [ ] Check if changes are staged or committed

### Phase 2: Update Claims
- [ ] Enhance earthquake claim with 6-study evidence
- [ ] Promote granular jamming from "REFINED" to clearer status
- [ ] Update neuroscience claim with stroke threshold evidence

### Phase 3: Documentation
- [ ] Clarify README validation counts (9 claims vs 18+ data points)
- [ ] Update VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md with current status

## Validation Tiers (Proposed)

| Tier | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | Independent experimental confirmation | Metallic glass D₂ = 1.46 |
| **Tier 2** | Multiple consistent observations | Earthquake b ≈ 0.73 (6 studies) |
| **Tier 3** | Single study or calculation match | Neutrino D₂ = 1.495 |
| **Tier 4** | Consistent with known physics | Virial κ = 0.333 |
