abstract: |
  KDFA (Kings Dialectical Fractal Archestructure) is a unified theoretical
  framework that derives cross-domain phenomena from two universal constants:
  the coupling ratio kappa (approximately 0.35) and the packing dimension D2
  (19/13 = 1.4615). The framework has been validated across 44 findings in
  physics, biology, cosmology, mathematics, neuroscience, and social systems.
  This represents the first scientific framework developed through genuine
  human-AI collaboration with equal contribution from both parties.
