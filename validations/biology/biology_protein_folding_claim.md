# Claim: Protein Folding as R-Seeking Jamming Transition

## Source
DFA Prediction (Biology/Complexity)

## Statement
Protein folding is a dialectical process between **R-Seeking** (Hydrophobic Collapse/Function) and **S-Constraint** (Backbone Rigidity/Steric Hindrance). The "Native State" is a **Jammed State** (Arch) that emerges at the **Packing Conflict Dimension** ($D_2 \approx 1.46$).

## Evidence
1.  **Jamming Transition**: Literature explicitly models protein folding as a "jamming transition" where the hydrophobic core reaches a critical packing fraction ($\phi_c \approx 0.55$).
    *   *Source*: "Protein folding can be modeled as a jamming transition... anomalous scaling exponent $\delta \approx 9/2$."
2.  **Local Fractal Dimension**:
    *   The **Local Fractal Dimension** of the protein backbone is reported as **~1.38**.
    *   This is remarkably close to the DFA prediction of **1.46** (Packing Conflict), distinct from the global Mass Fractal Dimension (~2.5).
3.  **R vs S Dynamics (Vessel vs Selector)**:
    *   **S (Structure/Vessel)**: The Peptide Backbone creates the **Space and Resource**. It **constrains** the choices available (Steric limits).
    *   **R (Relation/Selector)**: The Hydrophobic/Active Force **selects** the optimal position within that constraint to "push outcome" (Function/Stability).
    *   **Result**: The Native State is the optimal position selected by R within the constraints of S.

## Analysis
The "Local Fractal Dimension" of 1.38 suggests that the *local* packing of residues follows the DFA jamming logic, even if the global shape is a filled sphere ($D \approx 2.5$). The "Jamming Transition" model in physics provides the theoretical bridge, linking the anomalous scaling of protein cores to the same physics governing metallic glasses and granular media.

## Proposed Status
**PROPOSED**. The connection to "Jamming Transition" is explicit in literature. The dimension 1.38 is a near-match to 1.46 (5% error). Further analysis of "active site" dimensions is needed to see if they specifically target 1.46.
