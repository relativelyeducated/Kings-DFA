# Claim: Derivation of Constants (C=0.35, alpha=37, N=456)

## Source
Grok Export 031

## Statement
- **\(\kappa_{crit} \approx 1/e \approx 0.368\)**: Critical **survival threshold** (often cited as 0.35). Below this, systems collapse.
- **Optimum Range**: 0.40-0.50 (Conditional). The optimal balance point is not fixed at the threshold but varies by system.
- **Variable \(\kappa\)**: The coupling constant is a variable \([0,1]\), not a fixed universal constant.
- **alpha = 37**: Fractal exponent derived from neutrino power spectrum \(P(k) \sim k^{-\alpha}\).
- **N = 456**: Basis truncation dimension. Derived from \(N = \lfloor 2^{D+1} \times 3! \times \pi^2 \rfloor / 2\) with \(D \approx 1.8\), adjusted for basis truncation.

## Context
These constants are presented as universal across scales in the DFA framework.
