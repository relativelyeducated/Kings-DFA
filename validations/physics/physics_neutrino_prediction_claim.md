## Statement
- **Prediction**: Anomalous mixing excess of ~12% at high energy (>100 TeV).
- **Derivation**: Based on the coupling constant \(\kappa \approx 0.35\) (now corrected to \(1/e\)) and the scaling factor \(37/456\).

## Validation Status
- **Observed**: IceCube reports a **2.8 sigma excess** in the 100 TeV range (2016 analysis).
- **Discrepancy**: No specific "12%" figure has been found in the literature to date. The "12%" remains a theoretical prediction from the DFA framework (possibly related to \(1/e^2 \approx 13.5\%\) or similar geometric factors) that awaits precise quantitative confirmation.
- **Current Status**: **THEORETICAL** (Qualitative support from 2.8 sigma excess, but quantitative match unverified).
