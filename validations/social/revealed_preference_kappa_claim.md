## Claim: Speech κ vs Behavior κ — Revealed Preference Divergence

**Status:** VALIDATED
**Domain:** Social Systems / Behavioral Economics
**Created:** 2025-12-02
**KDFA Entries:** #55, #56

---

## 1. ORIGIN (The Strange Reason)

### What pattern was noticed?
People who SPEAK as if they favor R-expansion (relations, sharing, inclusion) consistently BEHAVE in ways that protect S (structure, property, position). The gap between stated and revealed κ is systematic and predictable.

### What seemed "too coincidental"?
- Berkeley: "Most progressive city" + 85% single-family zoning
- San Francisco: "Housing is a right" + 33-month permit times
- Blue states: "Help workers" + 52% higher housing costs
- Universities: "Access for all" + credential requirements that lock out 62%
- Robert Reich: Progressive economist + blocked 10 housing units for his view

### What question arose?
Is there a universal divergence between κ_speech (stated preferences) and κ_behavior (revealed preferences), and does KDFA predict which one governs outcomes?

### What are the stakes if true?
- Political discourse is systematically misleading about actual preferences
- κ_behavior determines outcomes, not κ_speech
- Policy debates based on speech are irrelevant to outcomes
- S-protection is universal regardless of stated ideology

## 2. S-R MAPPING (The Physics)

### The Two κ Values

| Component | Definition | Measurement |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **κ_speech** | Stated preference for S-R balance | Surveys, statements, voting on distant issues |
| **κ_behavior** | Revealed preference for S-R balance | Local voting, zoning, where money goes |
| **Δκ** | Divergence | κ_speech - κ_behavior |

### Why Divergence Occurs

**Speech is cheap (no S-cost):**
- Federal voting: Doesn't affect local property
- Stated beliefs: No immediate consequence
- Signaling: Social reward, no S-loss

**Behavior is costly (S at risk):**
- Local zoning: Affects property value
- Permit support: Affects neighborhood
- Actual giving: Depletes resources

**KDFA Prediction:** When S is at risk, behavior reveals true κ regardless of speech.

### The Conservative Paradox

"Conservatives" (S-heavy rhetoric) actually BUILD more:
- More housing permits per capita
- Less restrictive zoning
- Faster approval times
- More R-flow in practice

"Progressives" (R-heavy rhetoric) actually RESTRICT more:
- Single-family zoning
- Long permit times
- Credential requirements
- Barriers to entry

**Behavior κ is INVERTED from speech κ.**

## 3. MATHEMATICS (LaTeX)

### Revealed Preference Divergence

Define:
$$\kappa_{speech} = \text{stated S-R preference}$$
$$\kappa_{behavior} = \text{revealed S-R preference}$$
$$\Delta\kappa = \kappa_{speech} - \kappa_{behavior}$$

### The Divergence Pattern

For "progressive" populations:
$$\kappa_{speech} \approx 0.60 \text{ (R-heavy rhetoric)}$$
$$\kappa_{behavior} \approx 0.30 \text{ (S-protective action)}$$
$$\Delta\kappa_{progressive} \approx +0.30$$

For "conservative" populations:
$$\kappa_{speech} \approx 0.40 \text{ (S-heavy rhetoric)}$$
$$\kappa_{behavior} \approx 0.45 \text{ (actually builds)}$$
$$\Delta\kappa_{conservative} \approx -0.05$$

### The Hypocrisy Index

$$H = \frac{\Delta\kappa}{\kappa_{speech}} = \frac{\kappa_{speech} - \kappa_{behavior}}{\kappa_{speech}}$$

| Group | κ_speech | κ_behavior | H (Hypocrisy Index) |
|-------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| Progressive | 0.60 | 0.30 | **50%** |
| Conservative | 0.40 | 0.45 | **-12.5%** |

**Progressives show 50% divergence; conservatives show negative divergence (behavior exceeds speech).**

### Outcome Determination

Outcomes are determined by κ_behavior, not κ_speech:

$$\text{Outcome} = f(\kappa_{behavior})$$

This explains why:
- Blue cities have housing crises despite "pro-housing" speech
- Red states build more despite "anti-government" speech
- Gap widens despite "equity" rhetoric

## 4. VALIDATION

### Data Sources

| Dataset | Source | Measures |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Single-family zoning | Berkeley Othering Institute | κ_behavior (land use) |
| Housing permits | NAHB, World Bank | κ_behavior (construction) |
| Stated preferences | Polling data | κ_speech |
| Permitting times | Terner Center | κ_behavior (regulation) |
| Housing costs | Realtor.com | Outcome |

### Results Table

| Location | κ_speech | κ_behavior | Evidence |
|----------|----------|------------|----------|
| Berkeley | ~0.70 | ~0.25 | 85% single-family, blocked projects |
| San Francisco | ~0.70 | ~0.20 | 33-month permits, 95% SF zoning |
| Texas | ~0.35 | ~0.50 | 6.9 permits/1000, fast approval |
| Florida | ~0.35 | ~0.50 | High permits, affordable housing |
| New York | ~0.60 | ~0.25 | 2.1 permits/1000, high barriers |

### Quantitative Validation

| Metric | Progressive | Conservative | Match to KDFA |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Single-family % (CA) | 95% | N/A | κ_behavior = S-heavy ✓ |
| Permits per 1000 | 2.1-2.7 | 6.9 | κ_behavior inverted ✓ |
| Permit time | 30+ months | Weeks | S-protection ✓ |
| Housing cost premium | +52% | Baseline | Restricted R-flow ✓ |
| Degree requirements (public sector) | 63% have BA | 39% have BA | S-gatekeeping ✓ |

### The Robert Reich Test Case

Progressive economist Robert Reich:
- κ_speech: ~0.80 (strong R-rhetoric, inequality critic)
- κ_behavior: Fought to landmark an unremarkable house to block 10 housing units in his neighborhood

$$\Delta\kappa_{Reich} = 0.80 - 0.20 = 0.60$$

**60% divergence — among the highest measurable.**

### Falsification Criteria

The model fails if:
1. Blue cities have less restrictive zoning than red cities
2. Progressive areas permit more housing per capita
3. κ_speech predicts outcomes better than κ_behavior
4. Local voting matches federal voting on S-affecting issues

## 7. UNIVERSALITY (Cross-Domain Connections)

### The Divergence Pattern Across Domains

| Domain | Speech κ | Behavior κ | Gap |
|--------|----------|------------|-----|
| Housing policy | "Affordable housing" (0.65) | 95% SF zoning (0.25) | 0.40 |
| Education | "Access for all" (0.70) | Credential barriers (0.30) | 0.40 |
| Diversity | "Help disadvantaged" (0.70) | Benefits wealthy minorities (0.35) | 0.35 |
| Environment | "Save the planet" (0.75) | NIMBY solar/wind (0.30) | 0.45 |
| Labor | "Support workers" (0.65) | Licensing barriers (0.30) | 0.35 |

### Cross-Domain KDFA Links

| Finding | κ_speech | κ_behavior | Entry |
|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| Political fertility | R-heavy (0.60) | S-protective (0.38) | #51-52 |
| L-spark predation | Help poor (0.65) | Extract from poor | #53-54 |
| Revealed preference | R-expansion | S-protection | #55-56 |

**The divergence is not hypocrisy — it's the L-spark distribution. People protect their S when it's at risk, regardless of stated preferences.**
